# Advent of Code 2023
For those who are unaware, Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of 25 programming challenges that are released in December during the run-up to Christmas.

There is a competitive element to the challenges, but like most users I am doing these problems for fun and for learning purposes. This is my second year attempting AoC, and while I only made it halfway last year I enjoyed it a lot.

I do not have a computer science education or background, came to programming through data analysis in R, and am primarily interested in data science. I am using these problems to learn more about CS fundamentals and probem solving using Python (in Jupyter). As such, my solutions are frequently inefficient but my goal is to solve problems myself and not use hints from others except where noted.
