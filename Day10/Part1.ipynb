    "This part is effectively pathfinding, and is something I have no experience with. I looked into the topic a bit during last year's AoC and read about BFS then but I didn't have time to try implementing it then. My solution here uses what is essentially a modified BFS to follow a loop path of \"pipes\". I used a couple of tutorials on the net for inspiration and did glance at a few solutions on the AoC subreddit, but the solution is my own (and much less elegant than some I saw).\n",

The shape of the pipe is thus no longer given explicitly, but it can be inferred from the pipes around it.

If there are an even number of pipes, two different points will be the 'furthest' but if there is an odd, there is a single furthest point. This can be calculated by ceiling division of the length of the list of pipes, here represented as floor division using a negation of the divisor to \"invert the floor\" to get the ceiling and a negation of the quotient to make the value positive. This is the answer to the problem!"
